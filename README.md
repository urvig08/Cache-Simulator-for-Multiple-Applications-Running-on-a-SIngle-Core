# Cache-Simulator-for-Multiple-Applications-Running-on-a-SIngle-Core
This report summarizes the work undertaken, approach and results observed by simulating a unified cache for multiple applications running on a single core. The project analyzes the results observed by comparing between two and three applications running on a single core using First Come First Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. The cache mapping functionality used are Direct cache mapping and Fully Associative cache mapping as the cache was supposed to be analyzed for extreme cache mappings for effective results. Also, the cache replacement policy used for the analysis is First In First Out (FIFO) as it gives the least effective performance compared to LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy thus the cache simulator is analyzed in the worst condition possible. The analysis also compares the performance by varying the block size.
